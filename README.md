2.	Target Audiences:
•	Elderly people who are leaving alone or don’t have anyone in their most precious time of need and can only relay open outside help.
•	Physically disabled people who don’t have someone near them when in an emergency or when help is needed.
•	Or simply someone who is ill and can’t go to a medicine store or hospital.

These are the people who have either asked for an ambulance but they will take too much time to reach them or people who have a much less serious kind of emergency that does not require the need of an ambulance for example one is simply too weak to walk to the nearest store which is within 500 meters and need some help to get a simple medicine. 

•	People who need very particular medicines as soon as possible. For example people who need certain medicine that’s very rare and expensive so that the nearby shops do not keep them or have emptied there supply and will be refilling it soon.

3.	Site Objectives:
•	To connect people who are in need of medical help to NSS, SHG, or other individuals who are ready to provide them with aide of specific kinds.
•	To let know of when a particular medicine is available in a nearby store.
